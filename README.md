html
Okay i first i thought of how many sections I wanted and i split them up, 
I wanted a header, main, and content so it would be easier to understand

in my header i just have my name and "tabs" you can click on some work some I havent put anything in yet

in my main section I wanted sections called about me, projects, and resume(dont know what to do for that one), they would have info inside of them that i want to put in them

in my content section i wanted to have everything where you can contact me like my phone number, email, github(dont know why i put that now), and a few other things for the future like twitter and linkedin

css
for css i looked at other code for help on what to do and i think i got it
i organized them as well with classes like "header-info", "content-info", and "main-info"

i forgot to keep writing what i did and I'm too lazy to do it now sorry
